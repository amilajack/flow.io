## Tests

Unit tests use the [Mocha](http://visionmedia.github.io/mocha) test framework with [Chai](http://chaijs.com) assertions.

Assuming you have installed Mocha, execute the following command in the top-level application directory to run the tests:

``` bash
$ mocha
```

All new feature development should have corresponding unit tests to validate correct functionality.
